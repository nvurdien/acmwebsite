# README

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS LTS version](https://nodejs.org/dist/v8.11.4/node-v8.11.4.pkg) (v8.11.4 at time of writing)
- A preferred Text Editor. I like to use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## How to Build

### Dev

In a terminal, navigate to the repository and execute these commands:

- `cd acmwebsite`
- `npm install && npm start`

A browser will launch and open the website. You can now begin development! Any changes made to the website will update automatically, no need to rebuild.

### Production

To create an optimized production build, run this command:

- `npm run build`

Or, in VSCode:

- Mac: `âŒ˜ + SHIFT + B`
- Windows: `CTRL + SHIFT + B`

This generates the `build` folder, which contains the files you will deploy to the server to be published for all to see! ðŸ‘€
