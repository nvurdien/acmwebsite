        description: "We all love a great feel good animated movie. From our old Disney cartoons to Moana, animation \
        technology has had a rich history of phenomenal advancements. One of such advancements is Ray tracing. Ray tracing \
        is a graphics rendering technique for generating images by tracing the path of light as pixels in an image plane and \
        simulating the effects of the path of light with virtual objects. Ray tracing is known for its ability to produce a \
        high degree of visual realism and has been adopted in recent Pixar animated movies such as \"Monsters Inc.\" and \
        \"Moana\". We will explore the making of a simple ray tracer that explains the nuts and bolts of how ray tracing works"

        description: "The Eiffel Programming Language and EiffelIDE was designed by Bertrand Meyer in his classic text: \
        OBJECT-ORIENTED SOFTWARE CONSTRUCTION.  It is used in industries where reliability and speed are critical, \
        including Aerospace, Banking/Finance, Manufacturing, and Telecom. One of its key aspects is Design by Contract, \
        a method of software construction that designs components of a system to cooperate using precise contracts, \
        with preconditions, postconditions, assertions and class/loop invariants to ensure the reliability of the \
        software created. \
        \nEiffel is an OO language that fully supports classes, inheritance and multiple inheritance, \
        abstract classes, polymorphism, dynamic binding, and generic programming. Eiffel has had SCOOP (Simple \
        Concurrent OOP) technology since 2011, which allows creating concurrent, OO programs, without having to use \
        threads, locks, condition variables, etc. In this talk, I will illustrate the use of these concepts in \
        improving the quality of software programs, and demonstrate the use of the EiffelStudio in creating quality \
        Object Oriented software on multiple platforms (OSX, Linux, and Windows)"
